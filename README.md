# Sales Forecasting Project

This project is focused on forecasting future sales using historical sales data.  
By leveraging time series and regression modeling techniques, it aims to help businesses make informed decisions about inventory, budgeting, and strategic planning.

## 1. Project Description

Sales forecasting is crucial for organizations to anticipate demand, optimize resources, and reduce uncertainty.  
In this project, the goal was to build a predictive model that can forecast sales values for future periods based on past patterns, seasonality, and external indicators.

Key objectives:
- Understand sales trends over time  
- Capture seasonality, trend, and cyclic components  
- Evaluate multiple modeling approaches  
- Deliver predictions with acceptable accuracy for business use

## 2. Tech Stack

**Languages & Tools:**  
Python, Jupyter Notebook

**Libraries & Packages:**  
`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`

## 3. Dataset

- The dataset contains historical sales records over time (e.g., monthly, weekly).  
- Each record includes features such as date/time, product identifiers, store or region (if applicable), and sales amount.  
- The target variable is **Sales** (the numerical amount to forecast).  
- Preprocessing involved handling missing data, outliers, and transforming features for model readiness.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During EDA, several insights emerged:

- Sales show **seasonal patterns** (e.g. peaks during certain months).  
- There is a **trend component** upward or downward over years.  
- Certain external or categorical variables (e.g., region, product type) correlate with higher or lower sales.  
- Lag features (past months’ sales) have predictive power.  

Visualizations created include time series plots, seasonal decomposition, correlation heatmaps, and distributions of sales across time segments.

## 5. Feature Engineering & Processing

To improve model performance, the following transformations and features were used:

- **Lag features**: previous periods’ sales (e.g. lag-1, lag-2)  
- **Rolling statistics**: rolling mean, rolling standard deviation  
- **Date-based features**: month, quarter, day-of-week, year  
- **Differencing**: to remove non-stationarity (if needed)  
- **Encoding categorical features**: one-hot encoding or label encoding  
- **Scaling**: standard or min-max scaling for numeric variables  

Data was split into training and validation sets along the temporal dimension (keeping test periods for final evaluation).

## 6. Model Building & Evaluation

Multiple modeling approaches were tested, including:

- **Traditional time series models**: ARIMA, SARIMA  
- **Regression-based models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor  
- **Boosting models**: XGBoost, LightGBM  

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using techniques like grid search or random search.

Models were evaluated using metrics suited for regression/forecasting tasks:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)  

Cross-validation strategies (time-series split) were used to ensure robust evaluation and avoid data leakage.

## 7. Results

The best performing model achieved:

- MAE: **[insert value]**  
- RMSE: **[insert value]**  
- MAPE: **[insert value]**  

Comparisons showed that models combining lag features, rolling statistics, and boosting algorithms yielded better forecasts than simple ARIMA or linear models.

Feature importance from the best model highlighted the significance of recent lag features, seasonal indicators (month/quarter), and trend-based features.
